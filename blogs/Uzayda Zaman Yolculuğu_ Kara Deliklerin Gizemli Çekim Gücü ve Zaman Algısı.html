            <h2>The Relativity Revolution</h2>
            <p>Einstein's theory of general relativity transformed our understanding of gravity from a simple force to the curvature of spacetime itself. Near black holes, this curvature becomes so extreme that time itself flows differently compared to more "normal" regions of space. Imagine two synchronized clocks - one approaching a black hole's event horizon while the other stays distant. Observers would see the near-black hole clock tick progressively slower in a phenomenon called gravitational time dilation.</p>

            <h2>Singularity's Grip</h2>
            <p>Deep within a black hole lies the singularity - a point of infinite density where our current laws of physics collapse. This cosmic anomaly creates gradients so severe that spacetime dimensions literally swap roles. The inward pull becomes inevitable not just in space, but in time itself, forcing all objects toward the future singularity as inexorably as we move through time in normal space.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Event Horizon: The Point of No Return</h2>
            <p>The event horizon isn't just a spatial boundary - it's a chronal divide. Crossing this threshold makes communication with the outside universe fundamentally impossible. From an outside observer's perspective, objects appear to freeze in time at the event horizon, while the falling observer experiences normal passage of time - until encountering the singularity's destructive embrace.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Wormholes: Cosmic Shortcuts</h2>
            <p>The mathematics of general relativity permits spacetime tunnels connecting distant regions. These theoretical wormholes, if traversable, could enable time travel by connecting different moments in cosmic history. However, quantum effects and the need for exotic matter keep this concept in the realm of speculation, challenging physicists to reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Foam and Chronal Turbulence</h2>
            <p>At sub-microscopic scales, spacetime itself may exist in a quantum foam state with constantly forming and evaporating black holes. Some theories suggest this quantum chronal turbulence could allow backward time travel through retrocausal particles, potentially resolving quantum paradoxes while preserving cosmic causality on macroscopic scales.</p>
