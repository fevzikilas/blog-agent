# Agentic Blogs
This project is built using a combination of AI agents, automation tools, and cloud services to streamline content generation, image processing, and data updates.

A new blog post is published every hour at:
ðŸ”— [fevzikilas.tech/blog-agent](https://fevzikilas.tech/blog-agent/)  as long as I pay my cloud services :)

This system ensures a continuous stream of AI-generated content, fully automated from creation to publication. 
## Technologies Used
Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation and refinement
Cloudflare for API-based image generation
Google Sheets API for data retrieval and updates
GitHub API for file storage and version control
Automation Tools for orchestrating multiple processes
Conditional Logic & Workflow Management for decision-making within agents.
